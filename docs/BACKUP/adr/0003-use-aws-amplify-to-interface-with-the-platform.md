# 3. Use AWS Amplify to interface with the platform

Date: 2019-02-18

## Status

Accepted

## Context

I need a setup and some developer tooling to be productive with "my platform".

## Decision

I use AWS Amplify to work with my platform.

## Consequences

beause I can use it out of the box and don't have to build it myself. It allows me to pick up the most simple best practices. And later I can extend AWS amplify to add more feature and components to it. Downside is it is based around cloudformation which is AWS specific so I have add something else for other providers.
