# 3. One ADR for each Repository/Topic

Date: 2019-01-09

## Status

Accepted

## Context

In the context of documention my own architecture in this notebook, facing the challange that one adding all ADRs to one folder for all the different topics of this notebook prooved hard to maintain.

## Decision

I decided to maintain the ADRs in seperate folders close to the "code".

## Consequences

This makes it easier to reference the architectural decisions inside the context. Using different folders makes having an overview hard, one option is using the same folder name and write a quick tool that creates a table of content of all ADRs.
