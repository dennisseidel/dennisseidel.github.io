Software Engineering is craftsmanship - that applies independent of context: Good sotware development principles should be used coding frontends as well as coding backends.

## Lessons Learned
* You should not require complex design documents and diagrams otherwise it is to complex
* [Writing code that isn't needed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOAq3YN45YE)
* [Not making the code easy to change](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCg_VoFW46s)
* [Being to generic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wxyOng0-14)
* [Incremental Development & Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjpkPe6-580)
* [Any time you find yourself stopping to think, something is wrong.](https://www.codesimplicity.com/post/the-secret-of-fast-programming-stop-thinking/) E.g. The most common reason developers stop to think is that they did not fully understand some word or symbol.

## [System Design](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer/blob/master/README.md)

Summaries of various system design topics, including pros and cons. Everything is a trade-off.

## Clean Code

TODO: Read the book and sumarize (find a [summary](https://gist.github.com/wojteklu/73c6914cc446146b8b533c0988cf8d29) I will adapt).
