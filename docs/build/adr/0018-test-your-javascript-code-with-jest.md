# 18. Test your javascript code with Jest

Date: 2019-08-18

## Status

Accepted

## Context

There are many javascirpt testing frameworks. To test my serverless code I need to select a framework that works well with serverless, typescript and has a good ecosystem.

## Decision

I test my code with Jest.

## Consequences

Jest will make testing easy with low configuration as well as having large ecosystem. Further it can be used on the frontend as well as on the backend.[source](https://2018.stateofjs.com/testing/conclusion/)
