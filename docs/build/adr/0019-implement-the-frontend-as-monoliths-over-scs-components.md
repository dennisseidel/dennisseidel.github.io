# 19. Implement the frontend as monoliths over SCS components

Date: 2019-10-11

## Status

Accepted

## Context

As application get bigger and more complex they need to be modularize to be maintainable. One option is to let one team build everything from the frontend to the backend. But this requires the use of micro-frontends / ui components. This has show as complex. The current setup was very complex to understand when I came back after some time - therefore I need to simplify it. 

## Decision

Implement the frontends as moniltihs over SCS components.

## Consequences

This will simplify the development and bring it more in line with the mainstream. I hope with this setup it will be easier to come back to the application and continue working with it.
