# 20. Implement backends in Golang

Date: 2019-10-11

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Especially for serverless applications the cold start times are essential. Threfore I need a programming language that is very efficient, allows me to write clean code, is fast to learn. One option would be Golang the other option would be sticking with python or typescript or use Java. Java is mostly used in the projects I want to work on but it is not effient with cold starts. Therefore I prefer Golang, that allows me to improve my programming skills that can then be transfered to Java if required.

## Decision

Implement Backends in Golang.

## Consequences

What becomes easier or more difficult to do and any risks introduced by the change that will need to be mitigated.
