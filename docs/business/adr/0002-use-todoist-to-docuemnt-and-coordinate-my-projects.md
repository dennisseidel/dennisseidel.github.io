Supercedes [1. Use MS Teams to document and coordinate my projects](0001-use-ms-teams-to-document-and-coordinate-my-projects.md)

## Context

The project needs one space for end to end documentation and colaboration. From managing the different steps in the todos. Microsoft Teams is good for collboaration but it is not integrated with my todo and project management workflow.

## Decision

I use **Todoist** for the project management. It is my single inbox for my todos and information. ADRs and development documentation are best included into the code or near the code - the other parts should be in a seperate single space. It would be best if this space is interactive.

## Consequences

This will make it easier to integrate it into my daily workflow. While make it harder to collaborate with others, I have to keep an eye on this and find a way to integrate this as good as possible. (e.g. link in the comment of the project to the project planning tools of the different projects like Github for Dataplattform).
