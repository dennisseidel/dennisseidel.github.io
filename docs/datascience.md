> AI is at the center of modern application development as it allows for easy ways to automated traditional human tasks like classifications (question -> answer).

## Architectural Decisions

* [ADR-0002](adr/adr2.html) - Focus on theory or application for machine learning
* [ADR-0003](adr/adr3.html) - For Machine learning select a vendor specific stack of a general stack
* [ADR-0006](adr/adr6.html) - I use AWS for ML and Event Driven Architecture

## Software Development

Software Development is changing because of AI the actual "logic coding" is done by optimization - the algorithm itself. The new process looks like

1. Design a "code skeleton" 
2. Measure performance: this requires data to evaluate if something is right or not (human task, and decision factor if a problem can be solved this way)
3. Update (automated process) 

The benefit is that this requires much less domain knowledge. Human Tasks in this chain are: find example to evaluate / samples (labels), maintain surrounding data infrastructure.

The old approaches are still needed for OS Programming, Evaluation & Visualisation, Distributed Training & Node Communication.
