# 2. Use React for Desktop and Mobile

Date: 2019-01-10

## Status

Accepted

## Context

In the context of developing frontend uis, facing the problem that there are multiple frameworks for multiple target devices and I have only limited time I need to select a solution that allows me to build reasonanly fast solutions and that allows me to be active in the healthcare sector. 

## Decision

I decided for using React to achieve having a single technology for all frontends which requires javascript as the main skill and that is used in the healthcare sector and has a large ecosystem, accepting that I might not be as performant the native languages on iOS and Android and will not develop as fast as with VueJS and I will be not on the stack my current employer uses Angular.  

## Consequences

This will allow me to use a single technology for all devices and focus on developing my javascript skill. I will face challanges at my current employer but I will mitigate this by emphasizing that frontend development is not my job and will focus on other parts in my job.
