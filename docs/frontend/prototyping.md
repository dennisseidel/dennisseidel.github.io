### Rapid Prototyping {#rapid-prototyping}

To get feedback fast create a first prototype:

**Define Application Structure \(Paper? + Photo or Balsamiq + screenshot from rolemodels\):**

1. LandingPage \(login or not\)![](/img/landing-page-analysis.png)2. Personal Service Page \(only logged in\)

   ![](/img/personal-service-page-1.png)

### Build a mock?  {#build-an-app}

### Landing Page

Before developing the complete application test your app with a mock or a landing page. Check the steps and details in the sample [repo](https://github.com/denseidel/nosmoke.ai).

### Rapid Prototype

* Prototypes should be thrown away afterwards to ensure you make it cheap, fast, little.
* Focus on the end goal: user test or video for VC.
* Target Users: Low Fidality (Intenal & Social Circle (biase!) - talk with them, SMEs (know the market but outside) - use email, twitter and phone)  vs High Fidality (customer of the market, customer of customers - [Guerrilla Prototype](https://uxplanet.org/guerrilla-testing-with-your-prototypes-1f28536b64bc))

#### Questions that are useful for each stage of prototyping:

**Low-fidelity:**

- Is each main function of the app easily accessible to users?
- Do users easily identify what the functionality of the app is?
- What is getting in the way of their use of that functionality?
- What expectations do they have of potential supplemental functionality for the app?

**Med-fidelity:**

- For each screen, does the design of the screen work to guide users to the right functions?
- Does the user easily navigate through the app to find supplemental functionality?
- Do users easily find the interaction points we intend them to?

**Hi-fidelity:**

- Does the animation between each screen delight users?
- Does our use of color work to make their experience compelling?
- Do users like how the app reacts to touch gestures?
