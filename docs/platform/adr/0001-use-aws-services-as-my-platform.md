# 1. Use AWS services as my platform

Date: 2019-02-18

## Status

Accepted

## Context

I have to select which cloud platform and services to start working with or which services to build myself while considering learning time, feature, usability later in projects and cost.

## Decision

I will use AWS as my platform.

## Consequences

This will mean I can get started quickly, it is the most used cloud (while mainly for infrastructure and not services) at a reasonable cost and I don't have to invest the time to build and operate all the services myself. I have to talk care that and note proper abstractions that makes it possible to migrate those into a polycloud setup later.
