This weekend I started to migrate all my online resouces to this page. This includes my [Developer Playbook](https://den.gitbook.io/developerplaybook/), where I noted down all my tech lessons (including architectural decision records). As of today this has finished and the *Developer Playbook* will be maintained on this page in the future. 

Further at a later stage I will migrate as much content as possible from my [private blog](https://den.gitbook.io/developerplaybook/) to this blog. When this is finished I will this site will replace also my private blog.
