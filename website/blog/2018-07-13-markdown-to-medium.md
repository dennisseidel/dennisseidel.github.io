To keep the ownership of my content I decided to first publish my content in markdown on my own page - and then share it with the world on medium.com. Medium does not support markdown therefore I have to use the [markdown-to-medium npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-to-medium) to publish the post to Medium. The link includes a getting started and usage section.
