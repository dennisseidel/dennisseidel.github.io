There are so many ideas in the world that your idea is just one of many. People only use, invest in ideas and product they know, and will not use the best product if they don't know about it's greatness. Therefore one key activity of business is to promote and sell your product and idea. 

In large cooperation strick command line structures exist. Essential for promoting an idea is access to the stackholders mind. The strick command structure make it harder for getting the stackholders mind. Therefore hustling / promoting is even more essential in big companies. 

In the last year where I was responsible for promoting a special topic at my current employer I learn a lot how to approach **selling ideas inside large organizations**: 

* Create and maintain a pitch deck ([template](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1zgj-UYo5VECIUhPk7c9FgPPSDhSy7tSlNyqCbMfTVyM)) for your idea: You will need to promote your idea and enable others to promote your idea. The communication in large organization is more formal. Therefore a pitch deck in the main communication medium is very important. Share this as often as you can, better as a link as you want to update this contionously. 
* Focus on build the first PoC/MvP to show the product and get feedback: Time to market/customer is essential for the success of a product as the customer feedback improves the product the most. Getting budget in organisations is often challanging and slow and you don't have any ownership over this. You have at least some ownership over your time. Therefore it is essential that you have the capabilities to build a first PoC by yourself and that you protect your time for this rigorously. 
* Find supporters and build up a community
* Do the formal process (with as minimal effort as possible): The strick cooperation process require that you trigger this formal process as early as possible to have latern the budget to realize your vision. Doing this outside the formal process is very challanging and will fail if your idea requires some level of support from the organization (especially money) at some point.
