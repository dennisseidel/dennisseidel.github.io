As some of you my know I was always very interested in the healthcare sector, because I think it is one of the most important challanges we can tackle as humans: Understand how we can make use live better, healthier and longer. That's why I want to contribute to this sector. 

In the past one needed to study to become a doctor or scientist, today technology becomes also more important in each sector. So there is the possibility for an IT Specialist/Architect to contribute without going back to school for year. There is still some domain knowledge required but it s likely this can be picked up through studying on the side as well as practical experience. 

But what IT skill do Healthcare companies need? I started by looking at five types of healthcare companies: 

* "CRISPR" : Because I find this a very interesting field
* "Innovative healthcare companies" : To see where things are going

Some tech I could use: 
  - Crawler: https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy / https://github.com/binux/pyspider
