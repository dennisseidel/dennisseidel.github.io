## Find your product idea

To learn about product design I found a course on [Udacity](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud509/lessons/4289858997/concepts/42747890850923). After learning about different types of product ideas and the *hook* mechanic, I **started by brainstorming problems around me and solutions for these problems**. I evaluated the product ideas based on the: vitamin or painkiller, easy to monitize, simple, personally relevant, I can follow through, a big market and a secret souce.

## Test the idea

I chose the idea "A data based somke quitting support app that supports you in the essential moments by giving you the right counter trigger before the urge gets to strong". To test the idea and do some user research I can select between: *prototype*, *landing page*, *email* or *button* in existing product. As I don't have an existing product I found a landing page as the best solution to test the product idea, later I can get first feedback from sites like ProductHunt.  

### Landing Page 

I resarch some background how to build a quick landing pagge. You can check this out under [[1](https://medium.com/early-stage-startup-validation/how-to-setup-a-landing-page-for-validating-a-business-or-product-idea-d72c35fc012c),[2](https://producttribe.com/product-management/validate-product-idea-with-landing-page),[3](https://usabilityhour.com/validate-your-ideas/),[4](https://www.cortes.design/post/breaking-down)].

To validate your idea you need really need both acquisition and activation data. & Spend not more than 1 day on the landing page & Interate ! & Data is essential & I recommend that you plan to **spend most of your energy crafting clear and concise copy**. For the *actual design you can leverage pre-made templates* or services which cuts the time and energy necessary to get a page up. most important aspect moving forward is to set a KPI based on a call to action for your user, such as an email signup or third party authentication such as Facebook Login.
