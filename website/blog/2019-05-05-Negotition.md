In the last month there were intense discussion about the system architecture at work. And while we invested a lot of time nothing moved forward. This made me feel like I wasted a lot of time. But after I watch the Keynote about [TechLeads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLS6NXMXtLI) I realized that this is a greate opportunity to improve my leadership abilities.

I research and found the book __[Never Split the Difference: Negotiating as if Your Life Depended on It](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26156469-never-split-the-difference?ac=1&from_search=true)__ which teachs about the emotional component of human interatctions. So I decide to make an experiement, can I apply these principles and persuate the other parties involved to bring these dicussions to a good end?

After the first chaper I found two pratices.

- __Open Ended Questions:__ Whenever I negotiate I will ask open ended questions that make the other person understand my point. "Verstehe ich, aber wie soll ich XXX umsetzen/akzeptieren, wenn die Kosten ... so sind?"
- __Mirroring:__ Makes the other person feel connected. When I disagree I will say: "Sorry, [repeat the last part/important part]" and then wait 4/5 seconds.

Let's see how those two technique will work out. I will keep you posted.
